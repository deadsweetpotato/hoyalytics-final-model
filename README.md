# hoyalytics-final-model
This is the model I developed for the Hoyalytics training program's capstone.

## Project Outline
Given a sample data set for a UK-based department store, my team of consultants and data scientists analyzed the sales and operations of the business.

I took on the development of a model to sort the arbitrary list of products into concrete categories, in order to aid the consultants' analysis of product selection efficacy. In order to do so, I tried three iterations, before settling on a final model:

1) K-Means Clustering w/SBERT Word Embeddings
2) DBSCAN Clustering w/UMAP Dimenstionality Reduction
3) DBSCAN Clustering and UMAP Dimenstionality Reduction w/Noun Extraction, BERT Embeddings
   
*. A refined preprocessing of the data, with DBSCAN Clustering and UMAP Dimensionality Reduction on SBERT Word Embeddings

## Results
I achieved the highest scores in a cohort of over 75 participants in the program's final evaluations.
